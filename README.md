I am using a virtual envirement to run node js server and ubuntu as operating system.

1. To set up one use this tutorial:
    
    https://medium.com/@jaheenafsarsyedks/how-to-create-a-virtual-environment-for-node-js-479c743ef137

2. To start the server just activate the envirement comand (Note this is my activation path ../../node-js-projects/node-js-12.16 use your one path 'YOUR_ENV_PATH'):

    source YOUR_ENV_PATH/bin/activate # my vritaul env is node-js-projects/node-js-12.16
    
3. Then create a folder for the project (my folder is projects) and then set path in terminal with comand (Note this is my project path ../../node-js-projects use your one path 'YOUR_PROJECT_PATH'):

     cd YOUR_PROJECT_PATH/projects   
     
4. Then start the server with comand:
      node app.js
