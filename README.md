I am using a virtual envirement to run node js server and ubuntu as operating system.

1. To set up one use this tutorial:
    
    https://medium.com/@jaheenafsarsyedks/how-to-create-a-virtual-environment-for-node-js-479c743ef137

2. To start the server just activate the envirement comand:
      
        source ../../node-js-projects/node-js-12.16/bin/activate # my vritaul env is node-js-projects/node-js-12.16
    - Then create a folder for the project (my folder is projects) and then set path in terminal with comand:
         
            cd ../../node-js-projects/projects
    - Then start the server with comand:
      node app.js
